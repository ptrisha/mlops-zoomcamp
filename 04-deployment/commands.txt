Notes on command line

# Install packages with pipenv (for pipenv, I created a base conda environment for python=3.10)
pipenv install scikit-learn==1.2.2 pandas  pyarrow --python=3.10

# Docker commands (note the absolute path of the output parquet file in starter.py; 
# it was changed from subfolder because the file-mount option of Docker required output folder in an absolute path)
